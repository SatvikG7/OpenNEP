Previous Policies
The implementation of previous policies on education has focused largely on issues of access and
equity. The unfinished agenda of the National Policy on Education 1986, modified in 1992 (NPE
1986/92), is appropriately dealt with in this Policy. A major development since the last Policy of
1986/92 has been the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009 which laid
down legal underpinnings for achieving universal elementary education.
