The Vision of this Policy
This National Education Policy envisions an education system rooted in Indian ethos that contributes
directly to transforming India, that is Bharat, sustainably into an equitable and vibrant knowledge
society, by providing high-quality education to all, and thereby making India a global knowledge
superpower. The Policy envisages that the curriculum and pedagogy of our institutions must
develop among the students a deep sense of respect towards the Fundamental Duties and
Constitutional values, bonding with one’s country, and a conscious awareness of one’s roles
and responsibilities in a changing world. The vision of the Policy is to instill among the
learners a deep-rooted pride in being Indian, not only in thought, but also in spirit, intellect,
and deeds, as well as to develop knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support
responsible commitment to human rights, sustainable development and living, and global
well-being, thereby reflecting a truly global citizen.
