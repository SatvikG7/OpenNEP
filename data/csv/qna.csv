"What is the significance of teaching all languages with high quality to all students, regardless of the medium of instruction?","All languages will be taught with high quality to all students, emphasizing that a language does not need to be the medium of instruction for it to be taught and learned effectively, promoting linguistic diversity and proficiency among students."
Why is there an emphasis on exposing children to different languages early on?,"Research indicates that children pick up languages quickly between ages 2 and 8, and multilingualism offers significant cognitive benefits. Therefore, children will be exposed to different languages early on, with a particular emphasis on the mother tongue, starting from the Foundational Stage."
What teaching approach will be adopted for languages in the early years?,"All languages will be taught in an enjoyable and interactive style, emphasizing interactive conversation and early reading and writing in the mother tongue. Skills for reading and writing in other languages will be developed from Grade 3 onwards."
How will the government invest in language teachers across the country?,"Both the Central and State governments will invest in large numbers of language teachers, particularly in all regional languages and those mentioned in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India.
